  <p>
    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-northd</code> program
    monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN_Southbound"/> database.
  </p>

  <p>
    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

    Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
    <code>external_ids</code>.  This column has the same form and purpose each
    place it appears.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>external_ids</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      Key-value pairs for use by the CMS.  The CMS might use certain pairs, for

      those in this database.

      Specify a type for this logical port.  Logical ports can be used to model
      other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch.  Leaving this

        <dd>A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway.  In order

    <column name="parent_name">
      When <ref column="name"/> identifies the interface of a container
      spawned inside a tenant VM, this column represents the VM interface
      through which the container interface sends its network traffic.
      The name used here must match those used in the <ref key="iface-id"
      table="Interface" column="external_ids" db="Open_vSwitch"/> in the
      <ref db="Open_vSwitch"/> table, because hypervisors in this case use
      <ref key="iface-id" table="Interface" column="external_ids"
      db="Open_vSwitch"/> as a lookup key to identify the network interface
      of the tenant VM.
    </column>

    <column name="tag">
      When <ref column="name"/> identifies the interface of a container
      spawned inside a tenant VM, this column identifies the VLAN tag in
      the network traffic associated with that container's network interface.
      When there are multiple container interfaces inside a VM, all of
      them send their network traffic through a single VM network interface and
      this value helps OVN identify the correct container interface.
    </column>

    <column name="up">
      This column is populated by <code>ovn-northd</code>, rather than by
      the CMS plugin as is most of this database.  When a logical port is bound
      to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database <ref
      db="OVN_Southbound" table="Binding"/> table, <code>ovn-northd</code>
      sets this column to <code>true</code>; otherwise, or if the port
      becomes unbound later, it sets it to <code>false</code>.  This
      allows the CMS to wait for a VM's (or container's) networking to
      become active before it allows the VM (or container) to start.
    </column>

    <column name="enabled">
      This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this column is
      empty or is set to <code>true</code>, the port is enabled.  If this column
      is set to <code>false</code>, the port is disabled.  A disabled port has all
      ingress and egress traffic dropped.

      <var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>.
      Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single
      fixed Ethernet address.  The string <code>unknown</code> is also allowed
      to indicate that the logical port has an unknown set of (additional)
      source addresses.
    </column>

    <column name="port_security">
      <p>
        A set of L2 (Ethernet) addresses
        from which the logical port is allowed to send packets and to which it
        is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
        are permitted.  Logical ports are always allowed to receive packets
        addressed to multicast and broadcast addresses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each member of the set is an Ethernet address in the form
        <var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>.

  <table name="ACL" title="Access Control List (ACL) rule">
    <p>
      Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch
      that points to it through its <ref column="acls"/> column.  The <ref
      column="action"/> column for the highest-<ref column="priority"/>
      matching row in this table determines a packet's treatment.  If no row
      matches, packets are allowed by default.  (Default-deny treatment is
      possible: add a rule with <ref column="priority"/> 1, <code>1</code> as
      <ref column="match"/>, and <code>deny</code> as <ref column="action"/>.)
    </p>

    <column name="priority">
      <p>
        The ACL rule's priority.  Rules with numerically higher priority
        take precedence over those with lower.  If two ACL rules with

        packet is undefined.

        available in both directions).
      </p>

      <p>
        By default all traffic is allowed.  When writing a more
        restrictive policy, it is important to remember to allow flows
        such as ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery packets.
